Player/Stage Examples

This repository contains three simple programs, which can control a
robot modelled by Stage using Player's C++ interface. The test
programs are the following:

SimpleDumpData -- connects to the robot and reads some data from it

SimpleWander -- robot wanders through the stage and kills all the
                ghosts it finds on it's way.

CarryObjects -- robot collects objects in one corner of the table and
                brings them to the other. The simple gradient
                algorithm is used for path resolution, like the one in
                fasr.world example from Stage.

Good luck with learning Player/Stage!
